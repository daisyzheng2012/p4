            <h2>So it began</h2>
                <p>Thirty years ago, we started with one goal: to bake fresh bread from fresh dough every day in every bakery-cafe. No artificial preservatives or short cuts, just our bakers and hot ovens. And at the end of the day? We donated what was left to our neighbors in need.</p>

            <h2>Then we grew</h2>
                <p>As time went by, we opened new bakery-cafes across the country, and we looked for ways to get better. We added calories to our menu (long before we had to), provided free wifi (before it was popular) and switched to poultry and pork raised without antibiotics.</p>

            <h2>And here we are today</h2>
                <p>Now, with nearly 2,000 bakery-cafes in the U.S. and Canada, we still pay attention to the important things. Like serving food thatâ€™s free of the artificial stuff and making sure you have a great experience (have you tried online ordering?). All of this, what it all comes down to, is wanting for our guests exactly what we want for our own families. Simply: good food.</p>
